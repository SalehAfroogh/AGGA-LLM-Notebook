# **Navigating Academic Standards with AGGA: A Dataset of Academic Guidelines for Generative AI and Large Language Models**

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains the data, code, and results associated with the **AGGA (Academic Guidelines for Generative AIs)** project, which analyzes 80 academic guidelines related to Generative AI (GAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) from institutions across six continents. This study aims to provide insight into how universities around the globe are adapting to and regulating the use of GAI tools like ChatGPT in academic settings.

The repository includes:
- **Text Analysis**: Frequency analysis of keywords from academic guidelines, broken down by continent.
- **Network Graphs**: Visualizations of relationships between major keywords for academic guidelines, categorized by five types.

This project supports Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like model synthesis, ambiguity detection, and requirements engineering.

## **Folders and Files Explained**
- **`data/raw/`**: Contains the raw academic guideline documents in DOCX format for each continent.
- **`data/processed/`**: Text files generated by converting and cleaning the raw data, ready for analysis.
- **`figures/`**: Contains visualizations generated by the notebooks, including keyword frequency charts and network graphs.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration of text analysis and network graphs.
- **`AGGA.xlsx`**: Contains the AGGA dataset in Excel format.
- **`AGGA Dataset of Academic Guidelines for G...`**: Documentation of the AGGA dataset.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebooks.

## **Analyses Conducted**

### 1. **Frequency of Keywords (Across Six Continents)**
This analysis explores the most frequently occurring keywords in academic guidelines from six continents after filtering out irrelevant words.  
The top 10 keywords are extracted and visualized using bar charts, which help demonstrate the key themes across different regions.

**Example:**

- For Africa: Common keywords include `ai`, `students`, `learning`, `tools`, etc.  
- Each continent has a separate frequency chart that visualizes its key terms.

### 2. **Network Graph of Major Keywords (For Five Types)**
This analysis creates a network graph to show the relationships between major keywords from the academic guidelines.  
Five major types of keywords (e.g., `ai`, `chatgpt`, `tools`) are visualized in a network, with links representing relationships between these keywords across different regions.  
The graph helps visualize shared themes and connections between keywords in the global landscape of academic guidelines for GAI.

## **How to Use This Repository**

### **Requirements**
To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need the following Python packages, which are listed in `requirements.txt`:

- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`
- `networkx`
- `docx2txt`

### **Installation**
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AGGA-Text-Analysis-and-Network-Graphs.git
cd AGGA-Text-Analysis-and-Network-Graphs
pip install -r requirements.txt


### **Running the Analysis**

#### 1. **Text Analysis (Keyword Frequency)**
- Open the `text_analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for an interactive analysis.
- The notebook performs text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization) and generates bar charts of keyword frequencies.

#### 2. **Network Graph of Major Keywords**
- Open the `network_graph.ipynb` notebook for interactive exploration of the network graph.

### **Output**
- Bar charts and network graphs will be saved in the `figures/` folder.
- Processed data and results will be stored in the `data/processed/` folder.

## **AGGA Dataset**
The AGGA dataset contains 80 academic guidelines on the usage of Generative AI and Large Language Models in academia, collected from official university websites across six continents. The dataset includes 188,674 words and is available in Excel format (`AGGA.xlsx`).

### **Data Records**
The AGGA dataset is structured with the following details:
- **Guideline ID**: Unique identifier for each guideline.
- **Continent**: The continent from which the guideline was collected.
- **University**: The university issuing the guideline.
- **Name of Document**: Title or name of the guideline document.
- **Number of Pages**: Number of pages in the guideline.
